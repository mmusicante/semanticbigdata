Develop  a general  algorithm for planing query execution.

We start with  a query in OUR  datalog-like language, where indexes are indicated. 
One idea is to fix as indexes  terms involved in joins, since this can contribute to the reduction of the communication steps. 

Let us consider the query
$Q([x], sum(y)) \leftarrow A(x, [z]), B([z], y)$
to be executed. We suppose that relations A and B are distributed in 4 processors.

We propose general algorithms for constructing datalog query plans... according to the indexes "positions". 

We extend our first propositions to queries containing intentional predicates and we consider recursive queries.
